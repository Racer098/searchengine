                            <p class="mb-0"><br>Search engines are your gateway to the sites you visit everyday. They act as a middle man, allowing us to search for what we want and connecting us to what we’re looking for. But, because of their ability to view everything we do, they have become some of the world’s largest data collectors, including Google, Microsoft (through Bing), and Yahoo. These are all very non-privacy oriented companies, and even if you don’t have an account with them, they are still building a profile on your searches for commercial purposes. Obviously, this is a big privacy concern.<br><br></p>

                    <p><br>Luckily there are three very good options which we will discuss today, each with their own pros and cons.<br><br>The first service is DuckDuckGo, which is probably the most popular and widely used privacy search engine. Some of the nice things about DuckDuckGo is they have a beautiful UI, they are privacy-oriented and extremely public about the information they collect about you. In addition, they let you use tags to instantly search different search engines, and they offer an onion variant to be used inside of Tor.<br><br></p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Extra Information</h2>
                    <p><br>The second service out there is StartPage, which works a bit differently from DuckDuckGo. What StartPage does is they grab Google search results, but they supply it to you through their own service, stopping Google from seeing the user behind the search. People typically call StartPage a Google proxy, since all they’re doing is acting as a private middleman. Because you are getting Google results, you are going to have the best possible search experience using StartPage.<br><br></p><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/Echo-Alternativen.png">
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Concluding</h2>
                    <p><br>The last service is Searx me, It is commonly regarded to be the best search engine when it comes to your privacy. They are an open source metasearch engine, meaning they get results from several search engines and bring them to you using their service. It privately grabs results like StartPage does with Google, but it offers a lot more services, It actually grabs results from DuckDuckGo and Startpage as well, soooo yeah if you can go this route, I highly recommend Searx. The way they supply results is plain awesome.<br><br></p><a href="#"></a>
